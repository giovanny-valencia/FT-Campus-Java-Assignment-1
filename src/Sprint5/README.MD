# Todo Manager Sprint 5

-----------------------
## Liberties Taken
- Error handling with exceptions were handled locally instead of throwing and crashing the program.
- Some exception errors silently handle
- There is some repeated code snippets. Will clean up Main's repeated conditional user handling in future sprint.
-----------------------
