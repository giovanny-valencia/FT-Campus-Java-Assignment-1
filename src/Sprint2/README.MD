# Todo Manager Sprint 2

--------------------------
## Liberties Taken
- Used Scanner for user input.
- Using ArrayList instead of standard Array
- For the search requirement, request must be identical to retrieve a 1:1 match. 
Requirement did not specify returning multiple tasks.
---------------------------

## Problem Statement
Todo Manager is an application which can Manage our Tasks and keep track of our Tasks. In the course of 3 week we will be creating a Todo manager.
## User Stories
1. As a user I should be able to add the task into an array
2. As a user I should be able to update the task in the array
3. As a user I should be able to delete the task in the array
4. As a user I should be able to search a task from an array
## Instructions:-
1. Please refactor the code created in spring 1.
2. Please use arrays to store the tasks.
3. The application can be exited only if user enters 0 to exit. Else user should see the menu again and again.
4. Estimated completion time of the challenge will be 2hr.
5. Make sure you are uploading the code into git and giving the access to your mentor.
